    "* This project builds a Quantum Support Vector Machine (QSVM), a hybrid algorithm that combines classical machine learning with quantum computing.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The core idea is to replace the classical \"kernel\"—the part of an SVM that maps data to higher dimensions—with a quantum circuit. We will encode classical data (e.g., from a simple \"moons\" dataset) into quantum states, and then use a quantum computer simulator (via Qiskit) to measure the \"distance\" between these states in a high-dimensional quantum space.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The goal is to see if this \"quantum kernel\" can find patterns and separate data points that a purely classical SVM finds difficult, demonstrating a potential quantum advantage in machine learning."
